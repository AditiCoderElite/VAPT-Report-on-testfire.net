# VAPT-Report-on-testfire.net

This report presents the findings of a Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) 
conducted on a demo banking web application. The objective of the assessment was to identify 
security vulnerabilities and evaluate the overall security posture of the application. The scope of 
the testing encompassed the web application's front-end, back-end, and authentication 
mechanisms. Tools such as Burp Suite, Nmap, and OWASP ZAP were employed to detect 
vulnerabilities, including SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and insecure authentication 
practices. The assessment revealed critical, high, and medium-risk vulnerabilities, accompanied 
by actionable recommendations to mitigate these risks. This report emphasizes the importance of 
addressing these vulnerabilities to enhance the application's security and protect against potential 
threats.
